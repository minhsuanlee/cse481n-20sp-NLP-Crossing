### Team Name: NLP Crossing

### Team Members: Sam Lee, Shuheng Liu, Robin Yang

### GitHub URL: https://github.com/minhsuanlee/cse481n-20sp-NLP-Crossing

### Top Three Project Ideas:

1. **Chatbot Interviewer**
    - Pros:
        - High excitement among the team
        - Helpful for interviewees to elaborate on their own experiences
        - Have enough resources to succeed
    - Cons:
        - Might be challenging to find data of dialogues
    - Codebases/Platforms:

2. **Research Paper Summarizer**
    - Pros:
        - Could find many similar experiments online.
        - Help us understand how BERT works internally
    - Cons:
        - Moderate excitement among the team
        - If re-training may be required after some modification to the codebase, there may not be sufficient computing resource available
    - Codebases/Platforms:

3. **Discover What Else Can BERT Do**
    - Pros:
        - If succeed and is efficient, could help researchers write abstract
        - Find out if the model can capture what is important in a long corpus
    - Cons:
        - Relatively low excitement among the team
        - Difficult to find previous models that work on similar problems
    - Codebases/Platforms:

### Topic for Lecture or Class Discussion
- How does BERT work?
- What are the common approaches to analyze NLP models?
- How to combine voice recognition with various NLP models?
